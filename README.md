Project Name: Movie Recommender Module

Created By: Raushan Kumar

Date: July 11th, 2022.

Description: Becsically there are three types of recommendation approach/system. They are

Content Based -> In this approcah we collect information about the movie ex. genre,cast,crew etc and based on that we build.

Collaborative Based -> It is based on the user's similarity. ex. if user A shares the similar choice with user B then user B may get similar movie recommendation to the user A or vice versa.

Hybrid Technique -> This is combination of Content based and Collaborative based approach.

In this mini project i am going to use Content Based technique. Gathered ~5k records of IMDB movies rating and related data. I'll use only specifc fetures or those fetures which contributions are meaningful.
